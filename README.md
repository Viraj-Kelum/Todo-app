I developed and published a sleek, responsive Todo List application that enables users to efficiently manage their tasks. Key features include:

âœ… Adding and organizing tasks with optional detailed descriptions.

âœ… Real-time task completion and deletion functionality.

âœ… Timestamping tasks using Moment.js for enhanced tracking.

âœ… Unique ID generation with Nanoid for reliable task management.

âœ… Interactive user feedback powered by React Toastify.

The application is styled using Bootstrap for a polished, user-friendly interface, ensuring seamless usability across devices. This project showcases my expertise in front-end development and my ability to deliver functional, dynamic web applications.
